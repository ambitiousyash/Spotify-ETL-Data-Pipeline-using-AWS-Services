# 🎧 Spotify ETL Data Pipeline (AWS Serverless Architecture)

This project implements a complete **ETL data pipeline** that extracts track metadata from the Spotify API, transforms it using Python and AWS Lambda, stores the data in Amazon S3, and makes it queryable using AWS Athena. The entire pipeline is automated using **Amazon CloudWatch** and **S3 PutObject triggers**.

> ✅ **Note:** Due to Spotify API changes in 2024, only developer-registered playlists (like personal ones) are supported for data extraction.

## 📌 Features
- **Automated daily extraction** from a personal Spotify playlist using a Lambda function triggered by Amazon CloudWatch.
- **Raw data storage** in Amazon S3, organized as:
  - `raw_data/to_processed/`
  - `raw_data/processed/`
- **Transformation Lambda** (triggered on `ObjectPut`) parses and cleans:
  - `song`, `album`, and `artist` information
  - Handles bad/missing fields gracefully
- **Transformed data** stored back in S3 as CSVs under `transformed_data/`
- **AWS Glue Crawler** infers schema and catalogs datasets
- **Amazon Athena** enables querying with SQL
- **Cleanup**: Raw files are moved and `to_processed/` is cleared to prevent reprocessing
